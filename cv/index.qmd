# Professional

## University of Pennsylvania

### Business & Data Analysis Librarian

*October 2018 - Present*

Drawing on my business and educational backgrounds, I lead researchers to data, suggest resources for enhancing statistical analysis plans, organize business data services, build tools, and train learners in data retrieval and analysis tools.

## Famous Smoke Shop

### Project Manager

*March 2018 - October 2018*

Managing the transition from in-house sales-and-inventory management software with summary-level accounting to the NetSuite enterprise resource planning platform.

Not content to complete a theoretical Master's project, I collaborated with the email marketing team and a fellow statistician to apply statistical models and present recommendations for reducing email development times.

### Marketing Analyst

*June 2015 - February 2018*

Inheriting an established affiliate marketing program, I enacted compensation, communication, promotional, and compliance initiatives, increasing the channel's rolling 12-month revenue by $933,000 (35%) with a comparable (32%) increase in profit margin.

Simultaneously, I improved transparency and accountability by designing compliance standards and conducting audits that eliminated more than $36,000 in annual waste.

## Telerx

### Operational Excellence Supervisor

*October 2013 - May 2015*

When a high-profile client asked our free-text coding process to deliver greater reliability, I led a project that improved the average reliability by about 30%-60%. As a bonus, I also developed a statistical sampling plan that would save more than $50,000 in annual quality assurance labor.

Supporting a corporate Lean Six Sigma training initiative, I personally trained more than 140 Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belts, at leadership levels from Supervisor to Director, in less than one year. After that, I automated training for a conservative projected cost reduction of at least $8,000 annually.

### Process Improvement Project Coordinator II

*February 2012 - October 2013*

When leaders were stumped for ways to help their teams work faster, they would come to me. I led observational data collection and mined large CRM datasets then analyzed both qualitative and quantitative process data in order to identify and recommend a variety of untapped efficiency and quality optimization opportunities.

I also helped Telerx achieve EHNAC accreditation by formally documenting the corporate business continuity plan and laying the groundwork for specialized site and functional area plans.
