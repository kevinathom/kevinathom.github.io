If you want to maximize your protein density, however, take a look at my Clif Bar Bar Chart.\n\nTo gather the data, I enlisted Python and Beautiful Soup to read protein call-outs (among other details) from the product pages of clifbar.com. Then I pulled the details into R and used the lovely ggplot2 to customize a visualization suiting the subject matter.\nWant to know more about my process? Suprised pumpkin pie is such a slacker?
