I eat an unfair number of Clif bars. They're shelf-stable, generally tasty, and good for a protein boost. If you want to maximize your protein density, however, take a look at my *Clif Bar Bar Chart*.

To gather the data, I enlisted **Python** and **Beautiful Soup** to read protein call-outs (among other details) from the product pages of [clifbar.com](https://www.clifbar.com/). Then I pulled the details into R and used the lovely **ggplot2** to customize a visualization suiting the subject matter.
