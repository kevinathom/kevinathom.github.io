In 2018, I had the privilege of interviewing for the role of Business & Data Analysis Librarian at the [Lippincott Library of the Wharton School](https://www.library.upenn.edu/lippincott). The process included presenting strategies for data-driven research support and data visualization.

I researched expert advice and crafted an interactive dashboard in Power BI based on a real business analysis scenario sourced from an MBA student.

My presentation, in turn, guided my prospective colleagues through my process and findings. [You can view the slides and presenter notes.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cxCAtvIW_AcnPLs7U3VVf5n2ALuDWcgcrgmPQnAAHdQ/edit?usp=sharing)

My employment at the Lippincott Library began soon after. I'm humbled that the library team appreciated my perspective and honored to be part of the institution.

*Edit: Fresh new introduction, same great slides.*
